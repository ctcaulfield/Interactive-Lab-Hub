## Putting it All Together

Include here:
1. Your Arduino code.
```
#include <Servo.h> 

#define servoPin  10
#define switchPin 2

#define closePos  0
#define openPos   180

Servo servo;
int switchState;
int previousSwitchState;

// call this when the input on pin 2 changes (LOW to HIGH *or* HIGH to LOW)
void ToggleSwitch(int switchState)
{    
  if (switchState == HIGH)
  {
    servo.write(closePos);
    //Serial.println("switch state is HIGH.  servo.write(openPos) called to open useless box");
  }
  else
  {
    servo.write(openPos);
    //Serial.println("switch state is LOW.   servo.write(closePos) called to close useless box");
  }
  previousSwitchState = switchState;  // remember that the switch state has changed 
}

void setup()
{
  //Serial.begin(9600);
  //Serial.println("Useless Box Lab 5");

  // start with the box closed and the switch in the off postion
  switchState = LOW;
  previousSwitchState = LOW;

  // connect to our servo and make sure it is in the closed position
  servo.attach(servoPin);
  servo.write(closePos);

  // we should probably pay attention to the switch
  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT); 
}

void loop()
{ 
  int switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);
  if (switchState != previousSwitchState)
    ToggleSwitch(switchState);

  delay(20);
}
```

1. `.stl` or `.svg` files for your "bopper" â€” if you use some other technique, include the respective supporting material.

1. At least one photo of your useless box taken in the MakerLab's Portable Photo Studio (or somewhere else, but of similar quality).

1. A video of your useless box in action.

## Learning Experience

Unfortunately, shortly after recording the video above, the motor broke. Heart breakening because I could not successfully capture a video of it in the box. From this experience, I learned prototypes may not last long or break down easy! This is good to keep in mind if I were to ever create physical prototypes for a client. I would want to make more than one in case one of them breaks at the wrong time.
